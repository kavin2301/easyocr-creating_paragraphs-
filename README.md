Welcome to the EasyOCR Text Recognition project! This tool is designed to make extracting text from images incredibly easy. It not only grabs the text, but also organizes it into paragraphs and draws boxes around the text in the image for easy identification.

To get started, you'll first need to clone the repository and navigate to the project folder. It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for better organization, and then you can install the required packages such as EasyOCR, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. Once that's done, you're all set to start using it!

Using the tool involves loading an image, initializing the EasyOCR reader, and letting it detect the text. Afterwards, you can use OpenCV to draw bounding boxes around the text to make it easier to identify in the image. Finally, you can display the image with the text using Matplotlib, which makes it simple to visualize the results.

If you're interested in contributing, please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

A big thanks to EasyOCR for simplifying text recognition, OpenCV for handling the image processing, and Matplotlib for helping us display the results.

Enjoy working with this project and have fun extracting text from your images!
